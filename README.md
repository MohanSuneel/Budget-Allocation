# Garment Store Budget Allocation - Data-Driven Approach üõçÔ∏èüí∞

## Objective
The primary goal is to optimize the budget allocation for inventory in a garment store specializing in jeans. The allocation will be based on a data-driven analysis considering factors such as gender split and sizing considerations.

## Data
The following information has been gathered regarding jeans sizes and height ranges for both male and female customers:

| Gender | Size  | Height Range (in inches) |
|--------|-------|--------------------------|
| Male   | Small | 5'5" - 5'8"              |
| Male   | Medium| 5'9" - 6'0"              |
| Male   | Large | 6'1" - 6'4"              |
| Female | Small | 5'2" - 5'5"              |
| Female | Medium| 5'6" - 5'9"              |
| Female | Large | 5'10" - 6'0"             |

## Analysis and Budget Allocation üìäüí°

### 1. Gender Split
Analyzing market trends and potential customer base, let's assume a 60-40 split between male and female customers, respectively.

- **Male Budget Allocation:** 60% of 100,000 INR = 60,000 INR
- **Female Budget Allocation:** 40% of 100,000 INR = 40,000 INR

### 2. Sizing Considerations
Taking into account the sizing variations, we allocate the budget proportionally to cater to different sizes within each gender.

- **Male Sizing Allocation:**
  - Small: 20%
  - Medium: 30%
  - Large: 50%

  - **Allocations:**
    - Small: 0.2 * 60,000 INR = 12,000 INR
    - Medium: 0.3 * 60,000 INR = 18,000 INR
    - Large: 0.5 * 60,000 INR = 30,000 INR

- **Female Sizing Allocation:**
  - Small: 25%
  - Medium: 35%
  - Large: 40%

  - **Allocations:**
    - Small: 0.25 * 40,000 INR = 10,000 INR
    - Medium: 0.35 * 40,000 INR = 14,000 INR
    - Large: 0.4 * 40,000 INR = 16,000 INR

## Final Budget Allocation üéâüí∏

Considering both gender split and sizing considerations, the recommended budget allocation is as follows:

- **Male Jeans Inventory:** 60,000 INR
  - Small: 12,000 INR
  - Medium: 18,000 INR
  - Large: 30,000 INR

- **Female Jeans Inventory:** 40,000 INR
  - Small: 10,000 INR
  - Medium: 14,000 INR
  - Large: 16,000 INR

This data-driven budget allocation aims to maximize inventory coverage and cater to the potential customer base effectively. Adjustments can be made based on real-time sales data and market feedback for continuous optimization.
